        Welcome to Free Site Words! I was hanging with my daughter the other day waiting for her brother to
        finish soccer and thought I would quickly go over some site words with her. I ran a quick google search and
        we got completely inundated with ads. I understand that everyone just wants to make a quick buck, but I
        knew that someone out there would just offer up an easy site word app for free without all the hoops.

      </p>
      <p>
        I was wrong. So, here it is.
      </p>

      <p>
        This APP is free. There are no ads. There are no tracking cookies. I won't ask for your email, so you won't
        ever get an email from me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enjoy!
